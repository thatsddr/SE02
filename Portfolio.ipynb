The A* Algorithm explored 19.74% less vertices and 18.93% less edges while still finding the same path.<br/>This heuristic function can be improved in different ways, but it is important that its time complexity remains constant. If we really care about the performance of our algorithm but not about its optimality, we could use an heuristic function that does not guarantee optimality (in this case the fastest path) but explores less vertices. If we know the characteristics of the street network, or of a graph in general, we could create an heuristic that prioritizes some paths over others. In this case, we may want to prioritize faster roads, so what I came up with is an heuristic that looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h(currentV,finalV,speed) = \\frac{haversine(currentV,finalV)}{maxSpeed} * \\frac{thresholdSpeed}{speed}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically this heuristic function calculates how much time it would take to get from the current vertex to the final vertex, and multiply this value by a treshold speed divided by the current speed. In this way, if we set our treshold to $25m/s$ ($90km/h$), all the vertices in roads with a higher max speed will have an even lower priority (which means that they will explored before) because we will multiply the estimate by a number which is less than 1. For all the roads with a max speed less than the treshold, the priority will be higher (and so they will be explored later). This heuristic could lead to overestimates in many different situations, but especially to find two vertices that are really far away, this could make the algorithm really more efficient.\n",
    "Let's try to apply this heuristic to our previous scenario to see what happens:\n",

    "    <figcaption>\n",
    "        Terminal Output of the Non-Optimal A* algorithm.\n",
    "    </figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, in this case we still get the optimal result and compared to Dijkstra's algorithm it has explored 85.31% less vertices and 86.43% less edges. If we want to run our algorithm on very large maps, it could also make sense to dynamically choose between the two heuristics based on the distance of a vertex from the destination one."

    "Some info about the example scenario: the map used in both cases has an area of ~60km$^{2}$ and contains 3791 vertices. The fastest path contains 45 vertices while the shortest 55. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this info, another way to determine how well the algorithms did could be comparing the number of explored vertices to the number of vertices in the path. We could divide the number of explored vertices by the number of vertices in the path, and the closest the number is to 1.0, the more efficient is the algorithm. Alternatively, we could also divide the number of explored vertices by the numebr of total vertices in the map, In this case, the lower the number, the more efficient the algorithm.\n",
